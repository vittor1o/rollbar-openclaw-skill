# Rollbar Skill for OpenClaw

🐛 Monitor and manage [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com) error tracking directly from [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai).

## Features

- **List & filter** active errors by status and severity level
- **Inspect** item details and individual occurrences
- **Triage** — resolve, mute, or reopen items
- **Deployments** — list recent deploys
- **Top errors** — rank active items by occurrence count within a time window
- **Proactive monitoring** — pair with OpenClaw cron for automatic alerts

## Installation

```bash
clawhub install rollbar
```

Or manually clone this repo into your OpenClaw workspace `skills/` directory.

## Setup

The script resolves your Rollbar token from the first matching source:

| Priority | Method | How |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `$PWD/secrets/rollbar` | One-line file in your agent workspace containing the token |
| 2 | `$PWD/.env` | `ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-token` in your agent workspace |
| 3 | `ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Environment variable (injected or shell) |

**Option A — `.env` file (recommended):**

```bash
# workspace-myagent/.env
ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-token-here
```

**Option B — secrets file:**

```bash
# workspace-myagent/secrets/rollbar
your-token-here
```

> **⚠️ Security:** Never commit tokens. Use workspace-local files or environment variables only.

**Token types:**
- **Project token** (recommended) — Rollbar → Project → Settings → Project Access Tokens. Use `read` scope; add `write` only if you need to resolve/mute items.
- **Account token** (multi-project) — Rollbar → Account Settings → Account Access Tokens. Use with `--project-id <id>` to target specific projects.

## Usage

```bash
# List active errors
./skills/rollbar/rollbar.sh items --status active --level error

# Get item details
./skills/rollbar/rollbar.sh item 12345

# Top errors in the last 24 hours
./skills/rollbar/rollbar.sh top --hours 24

# Resolve an item
./skills/rollbar/rollbar.sh resolve 12345

# List deploys
./skills/rollbar/rollbar.sh deploys
```

See [SKILL.md](./SKILL.md) for full command reference.

## Proactive Monitoring

Set up an OpenClaw cron job to check for new errors automatically:

> "Check Rollbar for new critical or error-level items in the last hour. Summarize and alert me if any new items appeared."
